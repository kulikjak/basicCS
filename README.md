A few years ago, I wrote several algorithms for my friend teacher at high school as learning materials. Everything is written in C or optionally C++ for objects and operator overloading.

I recently wanted to learn Rust, and this code seemed like a good thing to rewrite. Now, since this is basically the first Rust thing I have ever written, they might not be 'rustic' enough, but they should work.
